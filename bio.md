I currenty live in Charleston, SC. I love travelling, surfing, reading, running and biking. I just returned from an amazing trip to Tofino, BC, a small surf town in Canada. I have lived in Japan and Taiwan and been to Costa Rica, Thailand, Venezuela, Mexico and China.

I am originally from Wisconsin, but moved away four years ago to live somewhere warmer and near the coast.
